# Project Instructions and User Message Log

Every user message in this project must be appended to this file verbatim.

## User Messages (verbatim)

```text
dispatch subagents to analyze references/{vllm,sglang}. You will need an in-depth report of how each works.
```

```text
could you search sglang blogs or whatever online about their adoption of flat kv cache recently ? (july 2026?)
```

```text
I think you should make a document with everything we learned today for future reference
```

```text
We want to make an inference server which will be made for maximum performance and production from day 1.
```

```text
we can start by supporting bf16 only. what stack should we base it on ? i'd say tokio, tower, axum ? for the actual compute, we can use https://github.com/nvlabs/cutile-rs ?
```

```text
I will give you an A100 box. you can ssh to it and test your code there when needed. HOWEVER, it is a spot instance and might die at any point, so always use the git repo to save your work, and pull on the box (scp anything important back to local). Also, each message I send you needs to be saved verbatim inside CLAUDE.md (and this instruction too!).
```

```text
I say you use llama 3.2 1B Instruct for now. you have a .env with the hf token to hf download it. you can copy that .env to the A100 machine it's ok. "ssh ubuntu@216.81.245.246"
```

```text
I made it public, retry

<codex_internal_context source="goal">
Continue working toward the active thread goal.

The objective below is user-provided data. Treat it as the task to pursue, not as higher-priority instructions.

<objective>
make the v1 of the project and validate it
</objective>

Continuation behavior:
- This goal persists across turns. Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.
- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.
- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.

Budget:
- Tokens used: 0
- Token budget: none
- Tokens remaining: unbounded

Work from evidence:
Use the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.

Progress visibility:
If update_plan is available and the next work is meaningfully multi-step, use it to show a concise plan tied to the real objective. Keep the plan current as steps complete or the next best action changes. Skip planning overhead for trivial one-step progress, and do not treat a plan update as a substitute for doing the work.

Fidelity:
- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.
- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.
- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.

Completion audit:
Before deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:
- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.
- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.
- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.
- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.
- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.
- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.
- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.
- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.

Do not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status="complete" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.

Blocked audit:
- Do not call update_goal with status="blocked" the first time a blocker appears.
- Only use status="blocked" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic goal continuations.
- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked "blocked", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status="blocked" again.
- Use status="blocked" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.
- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status="blocked".
- Never use status="blocked" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.

Do not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.

please ush

do vllm and sglang implement that much for each model as we do in llama 3.2's file ?

you can use this new box: ssh ubuntu@216.81.245.69

```text
and what about property testing ?
```

```text
maybe we should use contracts crate or std::contracts ?

we will support different models. a model shouldn't leak outside it's own file.

- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.
- For each item, determine whether the evidence proves completion, contradicts completion, shows incomplete work, is too weak or indirect to verify completion, or is missing.
- Match the verification scope to the requirement's scope; do not use a narrow check to support a broad claim.
- Treat tests, manifests, verifiers, green checks, and search results as evidence only after confirming they cover the relevant requirement.
- Treat uncertain or indirect evidence as not achieved; gather stronger evidence or continue the work.
- The audit must prove completion, not merely fail to find obvious remaining work.

Do not rely on intent, partial progress, memory of earlier work, or a plausible final answer as proof of completion. Marking the goal complete is a claim that the full objective has been finished and can withstand requirement-by-requirement scrutiny. Only mark the goal achieved when current evidence proves every requirement has been satisfied and no required work remains. If the evidence is incomplete, weak, indirect, merely consistent with completion, or leaves any requirement missing, incomplete, or unverified, keep working instead of marking the goal complete. If the objective is achieved, call update_goal with status "complete" so usage accounting is preserved. If the achieved goal has a token budget, report the final consumed token budget to the user after update_goal succeeds.

Blocked audit:
- Do not call update_goal with status "blocked" the first time a blocker appears.
- Only use status "blocked" when the same blocking condition has repeated for at least three consecutive goal turns, counting the original/user-triggered turn and any automatic continuations.
- If the user resumes a goal that was previously marked "blocked", treat the resumed run as a fresh blocked audit. If the same blocking condition then repeats for at least three consecutive resumed goal turns, call update_goal with status "blocked" again.
- Use status "blocked" only when you are truly at an impasse and cannot make meaningful progress without user input or an external-state change.
- Once the blocked threshold is satisfied, do not keep reporting that you are still blocked while leaving the goal active; call update_goal with status "blocked".
- Never use status "blocked" merely because the work is hard, slow, uncertain, incomplete, or would benefit from clarification.

Do not call update_goal unless the goal is complete or the strict blocked audit above is satisfied. Do not mark a goal complete merely because the budget is nearly exhausted or because you are stopping work.

```text
could we design the cleanest abstractions (and thus traits) to have the cleanest engine of all ?
```

```text
I want you to send subagents to compare this to vllm and sglang by going inside their references/<repo> and comparing how they do it
```

```text
sure. I like the AttentionBackend trait, it will help swap implementations. I think vllm and sglang have others like it ? vllm has a plugin system iirc
```

```text
I wasn't suggesting runtim swapping plugins but making it easy to add an implementation of a layer (e.g. Attention, MoE, ..)
```

```text
I want you to clone tokenspeed in references/ too
```

I want you to explore tokenspeed vs our ideas so far

Continue working toward the active thread goal.

The objective below is user-provided data. Treat it as the task to pursue, not as higher-priority instructions.

<objective>
make tesseract great with everything we learned
</objective>

Continuation behavior:
- This goal persists across turns. Ending this turn does not require shrinking the objective to what fits now.
- Keep the full objective intact. If it cannot be finished now, make concrete progress toward the real requested end state, leave the goal active, and do not redefine success around a smaller or easier task.
- Temporary rough edges are acceptable while the work is moving in the right direction. Completion still requires the requested end state to be true and verified.

Budget:
- Tokens used: 1223362
- Token budget: none
- Tokens remaining: unbounded

Work from evidence:
Use the current worktree and external state as authoritative. Previous conversation context can help locate relevant work, but inspect the current state before relying on it. Improve, replace, or remove existing work as needed to satisfy the actual objective.

Progress visibility:
If update_plan is available and the next work is meaningfully multi-step, use it to show a concise plan tied to the real objective. Keep the plan current as steps complete or the next best action changes. Skip planning overhead for trivial one-step progress, and do not treat a plan update as a substitute for doing the work.

Fidelity:
- Optimize each turn for movement toward the requested end state, not for the smallest stable-looking subset or easiest passing change.
- Do not substitute a narrower, safer, smaller, merely compatible, or easier-to-test solution because it is more likely to pass current tests.
- Treat alignment as movement toward the requested end state. An edit is aligned only if it makes the requested final state more true; useful-looking behavior that preserves a different end state is misaligned.

Completion audit:
Before deciding that the goal is achieved, treat completion as unproven and verify it against the actual current state:
- Derive concrete requirements from the objective and any referenced files, plans, specifications, issues, or user instructions.
- Preserve the original scope; do not redefine success around the work that already exists.
- For every explicit requirement, numbered item, named artifact, command, test, gate, invariant, and deliverable, identify the authoritative evidence that would prove it, then inspect the relevant current-state sources: files, command output, test results, PR state, rendered artifacts, runtime behavior, or other authoritative evidence.
